final

final is a keyword in Java which can be used in variable,methods and classes.If we use final keyword in a class name ,it means that that class can not be extended by another class.If a class is made final, then all the methods in that class are default final but variable are not If we use final keyword in a method, it means that we cannot override that method.If we use final keyword in front of a variable it means that that variable cannot be changed once its reference has been assigned.For example,

1. using final in case of a variable
void method1()
{
int a = 20;
a = 21;
final int b = 30;
b = 35  //we will get compilation error since b has been already made final
}

2. using final in case of a method
@override
final void method1()          //we will get error here
{
int a =20;
}
@override
void method2(){
int b = 20;
}

3. using final in case of a class
final class A{
public static void main()
{
     //
}
}
class B extends class A     // we will get compilation error here since final class A cannot be   extended
{   
}
