What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction


1. Abstraction hides the irrelevant data and shows only the relevant data reducing the complexities.
Encapsulation hides the data from outside world and reduces the complexities making it easy to handle for the end user.



2. Abstraction is not concerned about the implementation level,it only involves at the high level or at the design level whereas Encapsulation is involved at the implementation level

3. Abstraction example : In the case of a phone, here we are concerned only about the phone feature like it has a camera, we can call and text.Not concerned about its implementation.
Encapsulation example: Here, we are concerned only about taking picture,but not how camera works inside to capture pictures or how call is getting connected internally etc.


4. Abstraction uses abstract classes and interfaces where Encapsulation uses getter and setters and modifiers 

5. Abstraction focuses on what should be done  whereas encapsulation focus on how it should be done.
